Here you should put a file named 'users.txt'

It should contain somelines like this:

bear    raeb
fish    hsif
...


this means that you have two users named 'bear' and 'fish',
and user 'bear' has the password 'raeb'
while user 'fish' has the password 'hsif'


only someone holding the passwords could create knowledge in this knowledge base (knbase)
